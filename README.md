This GitHub account is for my class and anything else I decide to use it for further. 

I created a repository for my class and assignments. 

Cloning the repository to my system was pretty easy I just downloaded the desktop GitHub app and signed in to my account. From there it is just hitting the clone button, and choosing a folder to put the repository in to.
